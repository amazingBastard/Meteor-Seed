Meteor-Seed
===========

Meteor Seed is an application skeleton for a Meteor.js web app. The idea is to use this to bootstrap your meteor webapp projects with the dev environment mostly setup. The seed contains a sample MeteorJS application following the principles outlined in the book Discover Meteor. This app is just a way for someone who wants to use or learn Meteor.js to see how things work the Meteor way.
